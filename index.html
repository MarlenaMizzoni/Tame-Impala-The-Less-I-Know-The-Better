    <p>Someone said they left together</p>
    <p>I ran out the door to get her</p>
    <p>She was holding hands with Trevor</p>
    <p>Not the greatest feeling ever</p>
    <p>Said, "Pull yourself together</p>
    <p>You should try your luck with Heather"</p>
    <p>Then I heard they slept together</p>
    <p>Oh, the less I know the better</p>
    <p>The less I know the better</p>

    <p> Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?</p>
    <p>No surprise, leanin' on his shoulder like every night</p>
    <p>Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?</p>
    <p>Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind</p>
    <p>So goodbye</p>

    <p>She said, "It's not now or never</p>
    Wait ten years, we'll be together"
    </p>
    <p>I said, "Better late than never</p>
    <p>Just don't make me wait forever"</p>
    <p>Don't make me wait forever</p>
    <p>Don't make me wait forever</p>

    <P> I was doing fine without ya</P>
    <P>'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase</P>
    <P>Givin' in to all his bullshit</P>
    <p>Is this what you want? Is this who you are?</p>
    <p>I was doing fine without ya</p>
    <p>'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine</p>
    <p>All sweet talkin', where he wants ya</p>
    <p>So, come on, Superman, say your stupid line</p>
    <p>So, come on, Superman, say your stupid line</p>
    <p>So, come on, Superman, say your stupid line</p>
